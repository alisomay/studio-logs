# studio-logs

Includes non-sensitive data to archive and share developments about our studio with peers.

This repository is not meant to be used publicly, will not accept any PRs and basically irrelevant to anyone outside of our studio.

The sole purpose is to keep track of our studio's developments, changes, and improvements.

It is public because my peers are possibly not github users and this is the most convenient way for me to track and share selected information with them.
